LLVM IR is in .ll files; if an .ll file has a corresponding .c file, then the
.ll file can be generated by calling clang::

    clang -cc1 -emit-llvm <file.c>

Or use the provided build-opt-ir.py script that also invokes opt, in order
to build optimized IR:

    ./build-opt-ir.py <file.c>

Note: this works for now, but in the longer run we want to run pnacl-clang
instead, because we're interested in valid PNaCl bitcode, rather than the more
generic LLVM IR; Subzero is supposed to run the PNaCl ABI verifier, like the
existing PNaCl translator.
