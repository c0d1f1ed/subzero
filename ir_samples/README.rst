LLVM IR is in .ll files; if an .ll file has a corresponding .c file, then the
.ll file can be generated by calling clang::

    clang -cc1 -emit-llvm <file.c>

Or use the provided build-opt-ir.py script that also invokes opt, in order
to build optimized IR:

    ./build-opt-ir.py <file.c>

Experimental support is also added for generating PNaCl bitcode from C files,
with the script build-pnacl-ir.py; the end result of that script is simplified
PNaCl bitcode in LLVM IR format (textual).
